    <string name="text_bio">While well log data shows us information about the properties of the rock layer, seismic shows us information about the boundaries between rock layers. This means that changes in fluid content, porosities, and other properties within a rock layer will show up as changes in seismic amplitudes at the interface between the layers in a seismic data. However, with seismic inversion, seismic is transferred into layer property such as impedance. This allows us to confidently extrapolate in 3D what we can see at the well location to aid reservoir characterization away from wells across the study area. Seismic inversion process removes the imprint of the wavelet from the seismic data in a deconvolution process and then converts the results to impedance. Many geologic features can express similar P-impedance, thus, Post Stack Inversion may not sufficiently differentiate geologic features with similar P- impedance signatures since it solves for only P-impedance. Pre Stack or Simultaneous Inversion, on the other hand, solves for S-impedance and Density, in addition to P-impedance. It is for this reason that pre stack seismic data has been considered for this study.</string>
